# Getting Started

`Piral.Blazor` exists in multiple forms. Right now, we have:

- `Piral.Blazor.Core`, which is made to be consumed in a JavaScript / SPA created with the [Piral](https://docs.piral.io) framework
- `Piral.Blazor.Orchestrator`, which is made to be consumed in an ASP.NET Core web application to enable server-side micro frontends

While both are fundamentally different, they share the same goals and have an overlapping development philosophy.

::: info
`Piral.Blazor.Core` is never directly referenced, you'd rather install the [`blazor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blazor) npm package.
