# SPA Setup

In this document we assume that you already have an app shell using Piral. Otherwise, please check out the [Piral documentation](https://docs.piral.io).

Once you set up your app shell you either need to integrate `piral-blazor` into it, or create a micro frontend that uses `piral-blazor` in standalone mode. Both ways are described in the [piral-blazor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/piral-blazor) npm package.
